## I designed this version of PintArch but, in reality, it is the simplified installation of my Arch Linux.
## It is not a pure Linux version on top of the kernel, but, with the same mentality as Linus Torvalds, I needed a version of an operating system for myself that met my needs to be light, simple, secure, and flexible.
## In my opinion, the Arch Linux distribution is perfect for this. It is one of the best Linux distributions for desktop use and for what I need because::

* It is a very up-to-date distribution (Rolling Release)
* It has a large community of very dedicated people https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux
* It allows me to install everything I want (I don't know of any software that I can't get to work on Arch)
* It is completely modular and adaptable to the needs of any user
* It always has the latest updates https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/ArchWiki:About
* It has a very well-documented source of knowledge (Arch Wiki) https://wiki.archlinux.org
* It has the best open repository from a Linux community (AUR) https://aur.archlinux.org
